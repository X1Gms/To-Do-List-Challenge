# React Challenge

Challenged by Gabriel Lobo, doing a To-Do List according the elecctro rules

# Rules

- The application should be programmed in TypeScript, or alternatively in JavaScript (ES6/7).
- The use of the ‘var’ keyword is forbidden.
- Use ‘async/await’ to handle asynchronous operations (e.g., retrieving data from the server).
- You can use any public package in the NPM repository.
- The use of utility libraries, such as lodash or underscore is forbidden.
- The use of promise libraries, such as bluebird is forbidden.
- You are encouraged to use ESLint and the Airbnb rules (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- The application must use the React library (https://reactjs.org/) for rendering its components.
- For your convenience, we strongly recommend you scaffolded the application using the create-reactapp tool (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- The application must use React Hooks (https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
- The application must use React Context (https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for managing its
global state (i.e., the “to-do list”).
- The source code must be published on a git repository. Make sensible commits and detail the
changes on the commit messages.
